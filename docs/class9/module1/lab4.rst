Lab 4 â€“ Advanced configuration protections using the OWASP Dashboard
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Apply some final configurations to protect against the OWASP Top 10

- Do a final review of the OWASP Compliance Dashboard

Build additional configuration protections against the OWASP Top 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. On the OWASP Dashboard, path **Security -> Overview -> OWASP Compliance**. Click on the expand arrow next to **A2 Broken Authentication**. We still have no Login Enforcement resources.  Again you can click on the **?** to see more info on Login Enforcement or any other protections.  

    - Under A2 click the link named **Not Fulfilled** next to Login Enforcement.

    - In the Authenticated URLs field enter ``/#/privacy-security/`` and press ther add button and ``/#/wallet`` and press the add button.  Based on app exploration we were able to see these are resources we should only be able to get to if we have authenticated.
    - Press the **Save** button below.  Then press the **Apply Policy** Button in the top right corner. 
    - Now press the link in the note message below titled **Learning and Blocking Settings Screen**

        .. image:: /_static/class9/enforcementURLs.png

    - On this screen check off the **Alarm** and **Block**
    - Press **Save** below and **Apply Policy** in the top right.
    - These protections are now applied to A2, and also the Login Enforcement protections in A5.


#. Back on the OWASP Dashboard, path **Security -> Overview -> OWASP Compliance**. Click on the expand arrow next to **A4  XML External Entities**.  Previous signature protections already are helping to mitigate these other XML exploits.  Here are the steps to apply disallowing DTDs.  

    - Navigate to **Security -> Application Security -> Content Profiles -> XML Profiles**.
    - Click the name of the default XML profile. (Typically we create a new profile, and we do not modify a default profile, but for simplicity and since we only have one application we will do so here)
    - Under Profile Properties, click the XML Firewall Configuration tab.
    - On the Defense Configuration list, click Advanced.
    - Clear the Allow DTDs check box.
    - Click the **Update** button.
    - Go to **Security -> Application Security -> Policy Building -> Learning and Blocking Settings Settings**.
    - Expand the **Content Profiles** section.  Place a check in the  **Alarm** and the **Block** settings next to **XML data does not comply with format settings**.  
    - Press **Save** at the bottom of the screen and **Apply Policy** in the top right corner.  
    - If you want to view the dashboard again you will see the A4 catagory is now at 100%.

#. Back on the OWASP Dashboard, path **Security -> Overview -> OWASP Compliance**. Click on the expand arrow next to **A5  Broken Access Control**.  Previous signature protections already are helping to mitigate some of these exploits.  We satisfied the **Login Protection** a few steps ago.  We now need to block **Disallowed File Types**.  

    - To view/edit the pre-configured allowed and disallowed file types go to **Security -> Application Security -> File Types -> Disallowed File Types**.  You can just view, and no changes need to made here.
    - To apply these blocks now go to **Security -> Application Security -> Policy Building -> Learning and Blocking Settings Settings**.
    -  Expand the **File Types** section.  Place a check in the **Alarm** and **Block** boxes for **Illegal File Types**. 
    - Press **Save** at the bottom of the screen and **Apply Policy** in the top right corner.  
    - If you want to view the dashboard again you will see the A5 catagory is now at 100%.

#. On the OWASP Dashboard, path **Security -> Overview -> OWASP Compliance**. Click on the expand arrow next to **A7 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.  If you remember, A1 Injection included the protections against a lot of signatures and one of those catagories was XSS.  We are not using any HttpOnly cookies in this app so the last requirement to earn us 100% needed is applying the blocking of **Disallowed Meta Characters in Parameters**.

    - To view/edit the pre-configured allowed and disallowed Meta Characters go to **Security -> Application Security -> Parameters -> Character Sets -> Parameter Value**.  No changes need to made here.
    - To apply these blocks now go to **Security -> Application Security -> Policy Building -> Learning and Blocking Settings Settings**.
    -  Expand the **Parameters Section**.  Place a check in the **Alarm** and **Block** boxes for both **Illegal meta character in parameter name** and **Illegal meta character in value**

        .. image:: /_static/class9/Illegalmetachar.png

    - Press **Save** at the bottom of the screen and **Apply Policy** in the top right corner.  
    - If you want to view the dshboard again you will see the A7 catagory is now at 100%.

#. Now for our last step, once again go back to the OWASP Dashboard, path **Security -> Overview -> OWASP Compliance**.
As you can see we are now 100% compliant in multiple catagories.  While it is nice to see completetion, the goal of the lab and the dashboard is not to reach 100% in all catagories.  It is give visibility that the security protections we are applying are actually protectiing against known risks.  It also helps to guide and document the process done on each security policy you build.
