At the shell prompt, type the following commands to restart the Juice Shop application. The first command will list the running docker containers. Note the STATUS. The second command restarts the docker container and the third command will list the running container where you should see the STATUS listed as Up for a few seconds which confirms the application was restarted.

.. code-block:: none

    docker ps
    docker restart `docker ps -lq`
    docker ps

The letters after ``docker ps`` are lowercase L (el) Q (queue) and the character on either end is a backtick.
